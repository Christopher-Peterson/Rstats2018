# Rstats Peer-led Seminar, Fall 2018
This is the repository for the peer-led R seminar, hosted by UT-Austin's [Center for Computational Biology and Bioinformatics](http://ccbb.biosci.utexas.edu/).  The goal for this class is to provide practical data science programmatic experience using R and RStudio. 

The class will meet on Tuesdays from 2-3 pm in PAT 617. 

# Installation and Setup Instructions

We will be using the recent version of [R (v. 3.5.1)](https://cran.r-project.org/); older versions may not be able to run some of the code and packages we're using.  Please download and install it on your computer.  Most of our work will be done in [RStudio](https://https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download), which will also need to be installed.  Please make sure that your version of RStudio is at least 1.1.

Once R is setup, please install the latest version of the tidyverse (`install.packages("tidyverse")`).  We also recommend the `cowplot` package.

## Course materials

Course materials are being managed by [Git](https://git-scm.com/) and [hosted on Github](https://github.com/Christopher-Peterson/Rstats2018).  You can either download the files directly (click the "Clone or download" button in the repository, then "Download ZIP"), or through RStudio (the recommended option).  You'll need to have Git installed and configured for use with RStudio [(instructions)](https://support.rstudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/200532077-Version-Control-with-Git-and-SVN).  Once you do that, follow the instructions on that page for creating a new project from a remote repository.  

# Textbook

For the first part of the class, we will be following along with [R for Data Science](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/index.html), a free online textbook.  This book will provide additional examples and cover some areas in more depth than we can get to in person.
